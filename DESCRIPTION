Description: Implementation of three methods based on the diversity forest (DF) algorithm 
  (Hornung, 2022, <doi:10.1007/s42979-021-00920-1>), a split-finding approach that 
  enables complex split procedures in random forests.
  The package includes:
    1. Interaction forests (IFs) (Hornung & Boulesteix, 2022, <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2022.107460>): 
    Model quantitative and qualitative interaction effects using bivariable splitting. 
    Come with the Effect Importance Measure (EIM), which can be used to identify variable 
    pairs that have well-interpretable quantitative and qualitative interaction effects 
    with high predictive relevance.
	2. Two random forest-based variable importance measures (VIMs) for multi-class outcomes: 
	the class-focused VIM, which ranks covariates by their ability to distinguish individual 
	outcome classes from the others, and the discriminatory VIM, which measures overall 
	covariate influence irrespective of class-specific relevance.
    3. The basic form of diversity forests that uses conventional univariable, binary 
    splitting (Hornung, 2022).
  Except for the multi-class VIMs, all methods support categorical, metric, and survival 
  outcomes. The package includes visualization tools for interpreting the identified 
  covariate effects.
  Built as a fork of the 'ranger' R package (main author: Marvin N. Wright), which 
  implements random forests using an efficient C++ implementation.
