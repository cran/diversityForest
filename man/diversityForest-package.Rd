\title{Diversity Forests}
\description{
The diversity forest algorithm is not a specific algorithm, but an alternative candidate split sampling scheme 
that makes complex split procedures in random forests possible computationally by drastically reducing 
the numbers of candidate splits that need to be evaluated for each split. It also avoids the well-known variable 
selection bias in conventional random forests that has the effect that variables with many possible splits 
are selected too frequently for splitting (Strobl et al., 2007). For details, see Hornung (2020).
}
\details{
This package currently features two types of diversity forests:
\itemize{
\item the basic form of diversity forests that uses univariable, binary splitting, which is also used
in conventional random forests
\item interaction forests (IFs) (Hornung & Boulesteix, 2021), which use bivariable splitting to model quantitative and qualitative interaction effects.
IFs feature the Effect Importance Measure (EIM), which ranks the variable pairs with respect to the predictive importance
of their quantitative and qualitative interaction effects. The individual variables can be ranked as well
using EIM. For details, see Hornung & Boulesteix (2021).
}
Diversity forests with univariable splitting can be constructed using the function \code{\link{divfor}} and 
interaction forests using the function \code{\link{interactionfor}}. Both functions support categorical,
metric, and survival outcomes.

This package is a fork of the R package 'ranger' that implements random forests using an
efficient C++ implementation. The documentation is in large parts taken from
'ranger', where some parts of the documentation may not apply to (the current version of) the 'diversityForest' package.

Details on further functionalities of the code that are not presented in the help pages of 'diversityForest' are found
in the help pages of 'ranger', version 0.11.0, because 'diversityForest' is based on the latter version of 'ranger'. 
The code in the example sections can be used as a template for all basic application scenarios with respect to classification, 
regression and survival prediction.
