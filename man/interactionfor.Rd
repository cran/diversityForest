\arguments{
\item{formula}{Object of class \code{formula} or \code{character} describing the model to fit.}

\item{data}{Training data of class \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, \code{dgCMatrix} (Matrix) or \code{gwaa.data} (GenABEL).}

\item{num.trees}{Number of trees. The default number is 20000, if EIM values should be computed 
(and 2000 otherwise). This value may be reduced (e.g. to 10000), if the computation burden is too large. However, 
for most datasets the default number of trees, 20000, should be well easily feasible within reasonable computation time.
See also the argument \code{restrict.depth}, which can be used to restrict the depths of the trees for large data sets to
save computation time.}

\item{importance}{Effect importance mode. One of the following: "both" (the default), "qualitative", "quantitative", "mainonly", "none". 
See the 'Details' section below for explanation.}

\item{write.forest}{Save \code{interaction.forest} object, required for prediction. Set to \code{FALSE} to reduce 
memory usage if no prediction intended.}

\item{probability}{Grow a probability forest as in Malley et al. (2012).}

\item{min.node.size}{Minimal node size. Default 1 for classification, 5 for regression, 3 for survival, and 5 for probability.}

\item{max.depth}{Maximal tree depth. A value of NULL or 0 (the default) corresponds to unlimited depth, 1 to tree stumps (1 split per tree).}

\item{restrict.depth}{If set to \code{TRUE}, the maximal tree depth will be automatically set to 15, if the data features more
than 1000 observations.}

\item{replace}{Sample with replacement. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sample.fraction}{Fraction of observations to sample. Default is 1 for sampling with replacement and 0.7 for sampling without replacement. For classification, this can be a vector of class-specific values.}

\item{case.weights}{Weights for sampling of training observations. Observations with larger weights will be selected with higher probability in the bootstrap (or subsampled) samples for the trees.}

\item{class.weights}{Weights for the outcome classes (in order of the factor levels) in the splitting rule (cost sensitive learning). Classification and probability prediction only. For classification the weights are also applied in the majority vote in terminal nodes.}

\item{splitrule}{Splitting rule. For classification and probability estimation "gini" or "extratrees" with default "gini". For regression "variance", "extratrees" or "maxstat" with default "variance". For survival "logrank", "extratrees", "C" or "maxstat" with default "logrank". NOTE: For interaction forests currently only the default splitting rules are supported.}

\item{always.split.variables}{Currently not useable. Character vector with variable names to be always selected.}

\item{keep.inbag}{Save how often observations are in-bag in each tree.}

\item{inbag}{Manually set observations per tree. List of size num.trees, containing inbag counts for each observation. Can be used for stratified sampling.}

\item{holdout}{Hold-out mode. Hold-out all samples with case weight 0 and use these for variable importance and prediction error.}

\item{quantreg}{Prepare quantile prediction as in quantile regression forests (Meinshausen 2006). Regression only. Set \code{keep.inbag = TRUE} to prepare out-of-bag quantile prediction. NOTE: Currently, not useable for interaction forests.}

\item{oob.error}{Compute OOB prediction error. Set to \code{FALSE} to save computation time, e.g. for large survival forests.}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads. Default is number of CPUs available.}

\item{verbose}{Show computation status and estimated runtime.}

\item{seed}{Random seed. Default is \code{NULL}, which generates the seed from \code{R}. Set to \code{0} to ignore the \code{R} seed.}

\item{dependent.variable.name}{Name of outcome variable, needed if no formula given. For survival forests this is the time variable.}

\item{status.variable.name}{Name of status variable, only applicable to survival data and needed if no formula given. Use 1 for event and 0 for censoring.}

\item{npairs}{Number of variable pairs to sample for each split. Default is the minimum of the square root of the number of independent variables divided by 2 (this number is rounded up) and 10 (i.e., a maximum value of 10 is used per default).}

\item{classification}{Only needed if data is a matrix. Set to \code{TRUE} to grow a classification forest.}

  The labeling of these values
  provides the information on the type of quantitative interactions the respective variable
  pairs feature. For example, consider a variable pair A and B and say the label reads "A large AND B small".
  This would mean that if the value of A is large and, at the same time, the value
  of B is small, the expected value of the outcome variable is (considerably) different from all other cases. For this type of quantitative interaction,
  the effect of B is weak for small values of A and strong for large values of B. See Hornung & Boulesteix (2021)

  quantitative EIM values of the quantitative split type associated with quantitative interaction effects 
  for which the expected values of the outcome variable are different, if the value of variable A is large 
  and, at the same time, the value of variable B is small.
  The list entries of the un-adjusted 'raw' quantitative EIM values are labeled with the suffix \code{.raw},

\description{
Implements interaction forests as described in Hornung & Boulesteix (2021).
Currently, categorical, metric, and survival outcomes are supported. Interaction forests feature the effect importance measure (EIM),
which can be used to rank the covariate variable pairs with respect to the impact of their interaction effects on prediction.
This allows to identify relevant interaction effects. Interaction forests focus on well interpretable interaction effects.
See the 'Details' section below for more details.
}
\details{
The effect importance measure (EIM) of interaction forests distinguishes quantitative and qualitative interaction effects (Peto, 1982).
This is a common distinction as these two types of interaction effects are interpreted in different ways (see below). 
For both of these types, EIM values for each variable pair are obtained: the quantitative and qualitative EIM values.\cr
Interaction forests target easily interpretable types of interaction effects. These can be communicated clearly using statements 
of the following kind: "The strength of the positive (negative) effect of variable A on the outcome depends on the level of variable B."
for quantitative interactions, and "For observations with small values of variable B, the effect of variable A is positive (negative), 
but for observations with large values of B, the effect of A is negative (positive)." for qualitative interactions.\cr
In addition to calculating EIM values for variable pairs, importance values for the individual variables are calculated as well, the univariable
EIM values. These measure the variable importance as in the case of classical variable importance measures of random forests.\cr
The effect importance mode can be set via the \code{importance} argument: \code{"qualitative"}: Calculate only qualitative EIM values;
\code{"quantitative"}: Calculate only quantitative EIM values; \code{"both"} (the default): Calculate qualitative and quantitative EIM
values; \code{"mainonly"}: Calculate only univariable EIM values.\cr
The top variable pairs with largest quantitative and qualitative EIM values likely have quantitative and qualitative interactions,
respectively, which have a considerable impact on prediction. The top variables with largest EIM values likely have a considerable
impact on prediction.\cr
If the number of variables is larger than 100, not all possible variable pairs are considered, but, using a screening procedure, the
5000 variable pairs with the strongest indications of interaction effects are pre-selected.\cr
NOTE: To make interpretations, it is crucial to investigate (visually) the forms the interaction effects of variable pairs 
with large quantitative and qualitative EIM values take. This can be done using the plot function \code{\link{plot.interactionfor}} 
(first overview) and \code{\link{plotEffects}}.\cr
NOTE ALSO: As described in Hornung & Boulesteix (2021), in the case of data with larger numbers of variables (larger than 100, 
but more seriously for high-dimensional data), the univariable EIM values can be biased. Therefore, it is strongly recommended 
to interpret the univariable EIM values with caution, if the data are high-dimensional. If it is of interest to measure the univariable 
importance of the variables for high-dimensional data, an additional conventional random forest (e.g., using the \code{ranger} package)
should be constructed and the variable importance measure values of this random forest be used for ranking the univariable effects.

\examples{
\dontrun{

## Load package:

library("diversityForest")



## Set seed to make results reproducible:

set.seed(1234)



## Construct interaction forests and calculate EIM values:


# Binary outcome:
data(zoo)
modelcat <- interactionfor(dependent.variable.name = "type", data = zoo, 
  num.trees = 20)


# Metric outcome:
data(stock)
modelcont <- interactionfor(dependent.variable.name = "company10", data = stock, 
  num.trees = 20)  
  
  
# Survival outcome:
library("survival")
mgus2$id <- NULL  # 'mgus2' data set is contained in the 'survival' package

# categorical variables need to be of factor format - important!!
mgus2$sex <- factor(mgus2$sex)
mgus2$pstat <- factor(mgus2$pstat)

# Remove the second time variable 'ptime':
mgus2$ptime <- NULL

# Remove missing values:
mgus2 <- mgus2[complete.cases(mgus2),]

# Take subset to make the calculations less computationally
# expensive for the example (in actual applications, we would of course
# use the whole data set):
mgus2sub <- mgus2[sample(1:nrow(mgus2), size=500),]

# Apply 'interactionfor':
modelsurv <- interactionfor(formula = Surv(futime, death) ~ ., data=mgus2sub, num.trees=20)

# NOTE: num.trees = 20 (in the above) would be much too small for practical 
# purposes. This small number of trees was simply used to keep the
# runtime of the example short.
# The default number of trees is num.trees = 20000 if EIM values are calculated
# and num.trees = 2000 otherwise.



## Inspect the rankings of the variables and variable pairs with respect to 
## the univariable, quantitative, and qualitative EIM values:

# Univariable EIM values: 
modelcat$eim.univ.sorted

# Pairs with top quantitative EIM values:
modelcat$eim.quant.sorted[1:5]

# Pairs with top qualitative EIM values:
modelcat$eim.qual.sorted[1:5]



## Investigate visually the forms of the interaction effects of the variable pairs with
## largest quantitative and qualitative EIM values:

plot(modelcat)
plotEffects(modelcat, type="quant") # type="quant" is default.
plotEffects(modelcat, type="qual")



## Prediction:

# Separate 'zoo' data set randomly in training
# and test data:

data(zoo)
train.idx <- sample(nrow(zoo), 2/3 * nrow(zoo))
zoo.train <- zoo[train.idx, ]
zoo.test <- zoo[-train.idx, ]

# Construct interaction forest on training data:
# NOTE again: num.trees = 20 is specified too small for practical purposes.
modelcattrain <- interactionfor(dependent.variable.name = "type", data = zoo, 
                                importance = "none", num.trees = 20)
# NOTE: Because we are only interested in prediction here, we do not
# calculate EIM values (by setting importance = "none"), because this
# speeds up calculations.

# Predict class values of the test data:
pred.zoo <- predict(modelcattrain, data = zoo.test)

# Compare predicted and true class values of the test data:
table(zoo.test$type, pred.zoo$predictions)
}
