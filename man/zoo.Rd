\title{Data on biological species}
\format{
A data frame with 101 observations, 16 covariates and one binary outcome variable
}
\source{
OpenML: data.name: zoo, data.id: 965, link: \url{https://www.openml.org/d/965/}

\description{
This data set describes 101 different biological species using 16 simple attributes,
 where 15 of these are binary and one is metric (the number of legs). The outcome 
 "mammal vs. other" (\code{type}) is binary.
}
\details{
The variables are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item \code{hair}. factor. Presence of hairs (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{feathers}. factor. Presence of feathers (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{eggs}. factor. Does the species lay eggs? (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{milk}. factor. Does the species give milk? (true = yes; false = no)  
  \item \code{airborne}. factor. Does the species fly? (true = yes; false = no)   
  \item \code{aquatic}. factor. Does the species live in the water? (true = yes; false = no) 
  \item \code{predator}. factor. Is the species a predator? (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{toothed}. factor. Presence of teeth (true = yes; false = no)  
  \item \code{backbone}. factor. Presence of backbone (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{breathes}. factor. Does the species breathe with lungs? (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{venomous}. factor. Is the species venomous? (true = yes; false = no)
  \item \code{fins}. factor. Presence of fins (true = yes; false = no)  
  \item \code{legs}. metric. Number of legs
  \item \code{tail}. factor. Presence of tail (true = yes; false = no)  
  \item \code{domestic}. factor. Is the species domestic? (true = yes; false = no)  
  \item \code{catsize}. factor. Is the species large? (true = yes; false = no)   
  \item \code{type}. factor. Binary outcome variable - type of species ('mammal' vs. 'other')
}
\verb{ }\cr
The original openML dataset contains an additional variable \code{animal}, which is removed in this 
version of the data set. This variable provided the names of all species.
